This is an image classification script. 
The basics are that it takes an input of 60,000 images of handwritten numbers between 0 and 9 and tries to guess what number they are with maximal accuracy.
The impressive part? I did it with only numpy - nothing was done for me.

I started this project on April 14th, researching - watching videos and reading textbooks - and figuring out how to do it on my own.
The main textbook I used is linked below.
The coding part took only a few hours - 4 or 5, over the course of 2 days - but the research was the main part. 

// TODO - update readme after testing
